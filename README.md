### For the sake of the story let's say:
We are aproached by a client from whom we gather the preceding stories.
We really want to go CD, but our client is kind of old fashion.

#### The first 20 Deliveries (00-NoDI app was delivered)
We went all in and we came out with an application that meets our client's criteria.
We delivered many times a day and talked frequently to our client. Our client kind of stalls and responds 
vagelly to our question. After 20 delvieries he realizes that our aproach doesn't fit his companies needs.

##### The old fashion down grade
Our client's developer team doesn't know dotnet core so he asks us to change our development to C# plain old framework. 
Furthermore, he wants to use this new thing called DI his heard about, because that service locator thing his developer use
is doomed or so he read at some blog.

##### Continuous improvement
From what we gathered our client's development does:
- Develop C# Framework apps
- Don't plan to learn dotnet core any time soon
- Use Service locator pattern
- Could be resistent to embrace that DI thing they are being forced upon

After a nice retrospective at our offices we realized that there is a framework that can solve all our problems.
**Simple IOC (MVVMLight lib)** has a kind of service locator flavor and uses DI. So let's meet out client's need and deliver some value.

### Patterns ilustration

To explain some patterns int this project I've implemented the following patterns:
- 00-NoDI
	- [Service Locator Pattern](SERVICELOCATOR.md)
	- [Poor man's DI](POORMANSDI.md)
- 01-AntiPattern
