#DI
##Never liked short names and miss leading conceptions
DI is buzzword that people through around happily usually referring to **Dependency Injection** but I'd say that in order of precedence as I was trained, we would apply:

- Good practices
	- KISS (Keep it simple *sweetheart*)
	- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
	- SOLID (Boy this is a big one)
		- Single Responsibility Principle
		- Open/Close Principle
		- Liscov Substitution Principle
		- Interface Segregation Principle
		- Dependency Inversion (Hence the confusion with Dependency Injection)
- PATTERNS
	- Service Locator
	- Poor man DI
	- Factory
	- DI/Service Locator (antipattern)
	- IOC
