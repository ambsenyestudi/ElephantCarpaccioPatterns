# DI

## Never liked short names and miss leading conceptions
**DI** is buzzword that people throw around happily usually referring to **Dependency Injection**. 

### Good practices why?
Everybody say that good practices are the best but when there is time to apply them. I **strongly** disagree.

I'd say that in order of precedence based on how I was trained, they would be:

- Good practices
	- KISS (Keep it simple *sweetheart*)
	- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
	- SOLID (Boy this is a big one)
		- Single Responsibility Principle
		- Open/Close Principle
		- Liscov Substitution Principle
		- Interface Segregation Principle
		- Dependency Inversion Principle
- PATTERNS
	- Service Locator
	- Poor man DI
	- Factory
	- DI/Service Locator (antipattern)
	- IOC

#### Dependency Injection vs Dependency Inversion and IOC
In all my years of career I've never found a person that could explain me de difference between Dependency Injection vs Dependency Inversion further
than saying that *Dependency Inversion* is the **concept** and *Dependency Inversion* is the ***way of applying the concept***.
